Practice Exercises for Expressions

Solve each of the practice exercises below. Each problem includes three CodeSkulptor links: one for a template that you should use as a starting point for your solution, one to our solution to the exercise, and one to a tool that automatically checks your solution.

1. There are 52805280 feet in a mile. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the number of feet in 1313 miles. Miles to feet template --- Miles to feet solution --- Miles to feet (Checker)

2. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the number of seconds in 77 hours, 2121 minutes and 3737 seconds.Hours to seconds template --- Hours to seconds solution --- Hours to seconds (Checker)

3. The perimeter of a rectangle is `2 w + 2 h2w+2h`, where ww and hh are the lengths of its sides. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the length in inches of the perimeter of a rectangle with sides of length 44 and 77 inches. Perimeter of rectangle template ---Perimeter of rectangle solution --- Perimeter of rectangle (Checker)

3. The area of a rectangle is w hwh, where ww and hh are the lengths of its sides. Note that the multiplication operation is not shown explicitly in this formula. This is standard practice in mathematics, but not in programming. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the area in square inches of a rectangle with sides of length 44 and 77 inches. Area of rectangle template Area of rectangle solution Area of rectangle (Checker)

4. The circumference of a circle is `2\pi r2πr` where `rr` is the radius of the circle. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the circumference in inches of a circle whose radius is 88 inches. Assume that the constant \pi = 3.14π=3.14. Circumference of circle template --- Circumference of circle solution --- Circumference of circle (Checker)

  where rr is the radius of the circle. (The raised 22 in the formula is an exponent.) Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the area in square inches of a circle whose radius is 88 inches. Assume that the constant \pi = 3.14π=3.14. Area of circle template --- Area of circle solution --- Area of circle (Checker)
