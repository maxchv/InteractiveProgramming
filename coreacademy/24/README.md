# Review
Great job using Phaserâ€™s Arcade physics plugin to make an entire game!

In this exercise we covered:

Creating sprites that are affected by physics.
Creating groups of sprites affected by physics.
Creating groups of sprites NOT affected by physics.
Adding Colliders objects between sprites and groups of sprites.
Creating a loop to continuously execute a function.
Pausing physics.
Restarting a Scene.
See what else you can do!

Instructions
If you want to challenge yourself:

Change the delay property of bugGenLoop to make the game more difficult.
Compare the difference between this.physics.add.overlap() and this.physics.add.collider()
Check for Spacebar input and make the player sprite do something.
Implement a High Score system.
