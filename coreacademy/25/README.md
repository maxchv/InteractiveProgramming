# Building a Multi-Scened Phaser Game
Phaser games are defined by Scenes. In a simple game, we might only use one Scene. In more elaborate games, we can use multiple Scenes to build out start screens, end screens, or even different levels.

In this lesson, we’re going to refactor (rewrite the code differently but still achieve the same outcome) an existing game’s code to include multiple Scenes. Along the way, we’ll discuss how to organize our code so that it is easier to maintain and debug.

With these techniques under our belts, we’ll be well on our way to build out multi-Scened games with Phaser!

Instructions
Look over the different files and how the code is organized. Then click on the game to transition through the scenes in the browser.

We’ll gradually applying this same logic to our code in the later exercises.
